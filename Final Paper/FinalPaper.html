After Napoleon was defeated in 1814 and the French Occupation of Spain ended, Spain was ruled by a monarchy, which was at times absolute and at times constitutional, until 1873. A brief Republic existed between the years 1873 and 1874, which was known as the First Spanish Republic. It was quickly brought down, and the constitutional monarchy was restored under the Bourbon family. The monarchy lasted until 1931 and was succeeded by the Second Spanish Republic. This Republic, while lasting longer than the previous Republic, also ended abruptly soon after its formation. </span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c14">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five years into that Second Republic, in 1936, after fearing further &lsquo;radical&rsquo; changes from a left-wing government, the military launched a coup. The rebels quickly seized a third of the country under their control but failed to take control of the capital, Madrid, and other critical cities in the country. The rebellion quickly escalated into a full-scale civil war. Francisco Franco, a general in the Spanish Army, emerged as the leader of the Nationalist (military rebels) side. As the war ravaged the Spanish countryside and cities, many lives were lost and atrocities were committed on both sides. Under the leadership of Franco, the Nationalists suppressed Republican support wherever they held control. This continued after Franco won the Civil War, during his reign as the leader of Spain until his death in 1975. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c14">The extent and methods by which Franco suppressed and persecuted the Republicans and their supporters remain an often forgotten topic in the grand history of the 20th century. This paper attempts to uncover the truth behind the victims of Franco&rsquo;s persecution during his reign. In fact, some of Franco&rsquo;s methods of suppression during the Civil War were used just a few years later by Nazi Germany during the Holocaust. In addition to the Republicans who suffered in Spanish territory, this paper will also analyze the experiences of a forgotten group of Spaniards who fell victim to the Holocaust during World War II. Finally, the present-day perception of these events in Spain will be covered. How does Spain address these painful memories decades later? How are these people remembered today in Spain, if at all?</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c14">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c25">&ldquo;</span><span class="c3">One thing that I am sure of, and which I can answer truthfully, is that whatever the contingencies that may arise here, wherever I am there will be no communism.</span><span class="c1">&rdquo;-Francisco Franco (1938).</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">The rise of Franco&rsquo;s Nationalist Spain, after the military coup in 1936, was yet another example at the time of fascism rising in Europe. Mussolini in 1922, led his group of fascists on a march in Rome, that culminated in his forming the first fascist government in Europe. A man who once looked up to Mussolini led his own fascist party to power in Germany in 1933. Franco did not succeed in swiftly seizing the government as did his predecessors. A long war, lasting nearly 3 years, was the cost Franco had to pay to control the government in Spain. Massive casualties were inflicted, and horrific inhumane acts were committed on both sides of the conflict. The rebels side, in particular, has been documented committing egregious acts against Republicans and Republican sympathizers. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">The form in which the Nationalist side handled the opposition can be argued as a sort of prototype to how Hitler handled his enemies during World War II and the Holocaust. Just as Franco learned from his fellow fascists who rose to power before him, Mussolini and Hitler took notes from the Spanish Civil War to prepare for the battles to come. Franco&rsquo;s friendship with the fellow European fascists was no secret, Mussolini and Hitler provided direct military support during the war. With their help, Franco was able to inflict massive amounts of destruction upon the opposing side, particularly from the air. Their assistance was instrumental to Franco&rsquo;s eventual victory. On the Republican side, the Soviet Union provided support, albeit less openly and less generously. This allowed Franco to easily paint the whole group of Republicans as Communists, which gave him justification for staging the rebellion and continuous fighting during the duration of the war. In reality, the communist and anarchists only represented a fraction of the Republican alliance. Franco&rsquo;s blanket statement was an effective propaganda tactic but wasn&rsquo;t all truthful. Because the Republican side consisted of many different groups, the atrocities, and killings they committed varied by region. However, the Nationalist side&rsquo;s actions were systematic and consistent throughout Spain, part of a coordinated effort to consolidate their rule.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c9 c15">In her </span><span class="c3">The Spanish Civil War: A Very Short Introduction</span><span class="c1">, Helen Graham details why the Nationalists felt compelled to kill and persecute the Republicans. According to Graham, Franco&rsquo;s, and other Nationalist aligned groups (Catholic party), insistence on portraying the war as a fight to exterminate Communism and radical liberalism in Spain lead to the increases in violence throughout the war. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">Their message was that Spain needed to be purged or purified. Sometimes they even spoke of the need for a blood sacrifice. These kinds of sentiments unleashed a savage repression that happened from the outset everywhere in rebel Spain, including in many areas where the military rebels were in control from the start, where there was no armed resistance, no political resistance to speak of either, no &lsquo;front&rsquo;, no advancing or retreating troops-in short, where there was no &lsquo;war&rsquo; according to a conventional definition of the term. What there was, however, was a culture was that the perpetrators carried in their heads. The coup had sanctioned its unleashing and thus opened its way to mass murder (Graham 28).</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">What Graham is uncovering is a war culture that encourages the extermination and suppression of their enemies. The amount of murder and injustice carried out during the Spanish Civil War was not like any conflict seen previously. Of course, it wouldn&rsquo;t be long after that Hitler would take this mindset to a new extreme. As Graham points out, the killing wasn&rsquo;t reserved to the political Republicans. The Nationalists felt threatened by a multitude of Republican officials, and by groups that represented a &lsquo;cultural change&rsquo; from the old traditional Catholic times. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">People of all ages and conditions fell victim to this &lsquo;cleansing&rsquo;. What they had in common was that they were perceived as representing changes brought by the Republic. This did not just mean the politically active - although Republican members of parliament or village mayors were primary targets for liquidation if caught. Nor did it only mean those who had benefitted materially from the Republic&rsquo;s redistributive reforms - though urban workers, tenant farmers, and agricultural labourers were killed in thousands. It also meant &lsquo;cleansing&rsquo; people who symbolized cultural change and thus posed a threat to old ways of being and thinking: progressive teachers, intellectuals, self-educated workers, &lsquo;new&rsquo; women. Rebel violence was targeted against the socially, culturally, and sexually different (Graham 29).</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">Graham goes on to provide a few examples of men and women, who fell to the &lsquo;cleansing&rsquo; of the Nationalists during the war. One of those men was Federico Garcia Lorca, a famous Spanish poet, playwright, and theater director. He was killed for his sexuality and his political beliefs&rdquo; (Graham 29). It is clear that during the war, the casualties spread much farther and wider than the constraints of the battlefield. Systematic oppression and murder accompanied the brutal fighting on the front lines during the Spanish Civil War. This is for sure, but to what extent did the Nationalists carry out their acts of horror? How many fell victim, what were their methods on a bigger scale?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c9 c15">Paul Preston, an English historian who is a specialist in Spanish history, particularly in the Spanish Civil War, addresses the extermination during Francoist Spain in his book titled, albeit controversially, </span><span class="c3">The Spanish Holocaust: Inquisition and Extermination in Twentieth-Century Spain</span><span class="c1">. To even compare an event in history to the Holocaust would stir up controversy. However, it is clear, that to Preston the events of the Spanish Civil War led to a form of cleansing so awful that it&rsquo;s worthy of carrying the title of &lsquo;Holocaust&rsquo; along with the Nazi extermination in Europe during World War II. He addresses the potential controversy surrounding his use of the word &lsquo;Holocaust&rsquo; but comes to the conclusion that no other word clearly describes the Spanish experience of suffering during the Civil War, and the few years following. Preston provides a detailed account of the reign of terror carried out under Franco and his supporters. He details the methods by which Franco carried out murder, torture, abuse, and exploitation of slave labor that will help flesh out the grim scene set up by Graham. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">Preston covers the reasons behind the institutionalized killings on the Nationalist side in a similar fashion to Graham so it will not be covered again in reference to Preston&rsquo;s research. The main takeaways from his work is the methods by which the Nationalists attempted to suppress the Republicans and Republican support during and shortly after the war. Three methods, in particular, will be covered:</span></p><ol class="c21 lst-kix_8tv5r4ltm0py-0 start" start="1"><li class="c0"><span class="c1">Mass Murder/Extermination</span></li><li class="c0"><span class="c1">Concentration Camps</span></li><li class="c0"><span class="c1">Slave Labor</span></li></ol><p class="c12"><span class="c1">It is again of note that all these methods were later used by Hitler during the Second World War.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preston details many different forms and groups of men aligned with the rebel side during the war that carried out mass murder during their campaigns in the war. Preston first focuses his attention on the institutionalized violence under the rebel-controlled territory during the war. He initially draws in the experience in colonial Spain. At the time, Spain had fragments of what remained of a once large colonial empire. Their remaining colonial possessions resided in North Africa in Morocco, just south of Spain. This region would end up being crucial to the rebel plans of taking control of mainland Spain. The military had a strong presence there, and once they secured full control of Morocco, they would be able to invade Spain from the south and attempt to take the crucial city of Seville. Preston&rsquo;s first chapters during the war is devoted to the terror that spread under rebel control in Morocco and subsequently to the South of Spain. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">Again, we see through Preston&rsquo;s narration that the extermination and purging of Republicans was no accident, it was institutionalized under the rebel chain of command. The task of overseeing the uprising in the Spanish colony was given to Lieutenant Colonel Juan Yague. Despite fears that Yague, may not be loyal to the Republic, he retained his post up until the uprising. Emilio Mola y Vidal, one of the leaders of the military uprising gave these orders to Yague: &ldquo;Six days later, Yague received a more detailed set of twenty-five instructions about the organization of the repression. They included the following: use Moorish forces; delegate control of public order and security in the cities to the Falange; arrest all suspect authorities; eliminate all leftist elements (Communists, anarchists, trade unionists, Masons and so on); shut down all public meeting places; prohibit all demonstrations; strikes and public and private meetings. These instructions were the blueprint for the repression unleashed on Spain&rsquo;s Moroccan territories on the night of July 17&rdquo; (Preston 133). During the rebellion, dissenters were shot and killed or sent as prisoners to a concentration camp. &ldquo;On the night of 17-18 July, the rebels shot 225 soldiers and civilians in Morocco (Preston 133). This sent a benchmark, an example of how future operations would be handled by the rebels. Mass murder and imprisonment seemed to be a favorite solution of the rebels during the course of the war. </span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The actions carried out early during the rebellion set a dark precedent for the rest of the conflict. The pattern of murder and imprisonment followed the rebels wherever they held control during the war. However, the Republicans were by no means innocent of committing war crimes as well during the war. It is easy to point the blame to the side of the Nationalists, as they started the conflict and are more often than not associated with fascist tropes of extreme methods of silencing their enemies. But, again, both sides contributed to the mass amounts of war crimes committed during the course of the war. Preston devotes the third section of his book to the violence that occurred in Republican occupied territory.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Preston goes on to detail during this segment in his book, the violence that occurred on the Republican front is mainly attributed to the radicals within the Republican alliance. It is important to remember that unlike the Nationalist side, the Republicans consisted of a plethora of different political organizations and parties that all came together in support of the Republic. While that included the Popular Front, a political coalition consisting of various left-wing political parties that won the 1936 election leading up to the rebellion, it also included more radical groups. The two most prominent radical factions being the CNT, or Confederaci&oacute;n Nacional del Trabajo, and the FAI, or the Federacion Anarquista Iberica. The CNT was and still is a Spanish Confederation of anarcho-syndicalist trade unions. The FAI is a Spanish organization of anarchist militants. The groups are often associated together using the abbreviation CNT-FAI because of their close relationship and frequent cooperation. From these two groups collected effort, originate most of the severe violence from the Republican zone.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c9 c15">The radical leftists&#39; goals during the war were not much different than the goals of the rebels. For the rebels, it was to eliminate the communists, for the CNT-FAI, it was to eliminate the fascists. Early after the war began, the CNT-FAI began preparing to fight against fascism using any means necessary. In Barcelona, deep in Catalonia far away from the initial positions of the front lines, a mob rose composed of radical anarchists, communists, and socialists proceeded to inflict violence and burn down the local churches. The CNT quickly established their stance on anti-fascism.&ldquo;In the short term, however, the CNT was set on clearing the ground for the building of the new world. Its mouthpiece, </span><span class="c3">Solidaridad Obrera,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;justified violence against priests and capitalists. The wave of criminality that had engulfed Barcelona was acknowledged and rationalized:... Three days later, on 1 August, the national committee of the CNT issued a manifesto which declared that &lsquo;no rifle should be silent as long as there exists a single fascist in Spain&rsquo;&rdquo; (Preston 227-228). While the CNT&rsquo;s doctrine sounds awfully familiar to that of Franco&rsquo;s it is important to reiterate that the CNT-FAI, only represented a radical faction within the large encompassing Republican alliance, while the doctrine of Franco was the norm for the Nationalists. This, of course, does not take away from the horrible violence committed by the radical groups in Republican Spain. However, there is a difference between programmatic extermination on one side, and lawless score-settling on the other: the implementation of concentration camps and slave labor was unique to the Nationalists. </span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Francoist concentration camps were briefly mentioned earlier in reference to the Morocco uprising and is mention multiple times elsewhere sporadically through most of Preston&rsquo;s book. Preston then near the end of the book devotes a section to Franco&rsquo;s larger instruments of persecution in the section aptly titled &ldquo;Franco&rsquo;s Investment In Terror&rdquo;. Preston goes into detail regarding the experiences some of the Republicans endured in one of the concentration camps. It is estimated that about half a million prisoners passed through concentration camps in Spain from 1936 to 1942. The mass imprisonment carried over after the war was formally over on the battlefield. Considering the number of prisoners the concentration camps accumulated over the course of the war, it was impossible to liquidate the population in a quick manner. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">The persecution of the Republicans as well did not cease once the military battle was completed. According to Preston, it dominated daily life well after 1939, the year the war was over.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">Systematic prosecution would continue in virtually every aspect of daily life into the 1950s. The mass of the Republican population would suffer from grinding poverty, with families deprived of their menfolk, women forced into prostitution, labouring men forced to work at miserable wages, schoolteachers deprived of their jobs and a rationing system that intensified social division. The worst hit was the prison population. As early as 15 August 1936, Mola had told his secretary, Jose Maria Iribarren, &lsquo;prison must be a place of atonement&rsquo;. Two and a half years later, the decision of the regime to ignore the Geneva Convention on prisoners of war ensured that the prisons and camps which held hundreds of thousands of Republicans would become what one of them called &lsquo;cemeteries for the living&rsquo; (Preston 507). </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">The mass amount of men that were held in these camps after the war became an issue after the war. The question of what to do with these men had to be addressed. If things commenced as is, and the men would be sent to trial and sentenced, it was estimated that it would take three years to get through the huge backlog of prisoners if no further arrests were made (Preston 508). Eventually, the decision was reached to force the prisoners to work. Thus the implementation of slave labor began.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;In January 1940, thousands of prisoners began to work repairing the war-torn Spanish infrastructure from the aftermath of the fighting. The use of slave labor allowed Franco to pay for the costs of the mass incarceration and the rebuilding costs of the ravaged Spanish land. &ldquo;The most extreme example of the exploitation of Republican prisoners was Franco&rsquo;s personal caprice, the gigantic basilica and towering cross of the Valle de los Ca&iacute;dos. Twenty thousand were employed, and several were killed or badly injured, in the construction of this mausoleum for the Caudillo, a monument to his victory which was intended, in his own words, &lsquo;to have the grandeur of the monuments of old, by time and forgetfulness&rsquo;&rdquo; (Preston 509). Furthermore, the conditions of the prisons were unbearable, and many died during the intense winter of 1940-1941. In 1954, the Francoist Ministry of Justice admitted that there had been more than 270,719 prisoners in 1940 (Preston 509-510). This figure discounted the 100,000 prisoners awaiting trial.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">In addition to Franco&rsquo;s own dream project, prisoners worked throughout the country doing all sorts of jobs. They worked on long-term public work projects such as the hydraulic schemes along various rivers in Spain (Preston 508). &ldquo;The largest such project was the Canal del Bajo Guadalquivir, dug out over 110 miles and twenty years, a huge irrigation venture in the interests of the same landowners who had backed the military coup. Begun in January 1940, it soon involved five thousand prisoners, among them Republican engineers, architects, doctors and accountants as well as carpenters, electricians, plumbers and builders&rsquo; labourers. Two thousand prisoners were used building mountain roads in the Pyrenees in Navarre. Many more were used on irrigation channels, dams and reservoirs&rdquo; (Preston 508-509). These jobs were mainly an effort to rebuild the damaged infrastructure after the war. They were also forced to produce various goods in primitive workshops, and more often than that work in dangerous mines deep below ground. The prisoners were paid next to nothing for their labor (Preston 510).</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">Franco&rsquo;s reign of terror during his tenure as the leader of Spain left an everlasting impact on Spain for the foreseeable future. Early on during his reign saw some of the worst and most widespread acts of murder and persecution in the world at the time. Of course, it wouldn&rsquo;t be long until his ally to the East, Nazi Germany would somehow manage to eclipse the horrors of Francoist Spain in the name of racial, not political, purity. A distinction that was clearly central to the blasphemous justification of the Nazi Holocaust as clarified by Himmler to Franco in 1940 (Preston 495). As Preston alludes to at the end of this final section in his book, the Spanish, although allies of the Nazis, were not all spared of the Nazi slaughter during World War II. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">Amidst the brutal realities of the Spanish Civil War, a group of Spanish Republicans was able to escape the terror of Franco and flee the country. The natural haven for these refugees was France, which shared a border with Spain in the north. But their freedom from tyranny was short lived. In September of 1939, World War II began. France and the United Kingdom declared war against Germany after their invasion of Poland. As Germany quickly overwhelmed the Polish forces into capitulation, the Western front was for the most part very quiet. France held their ground behind the heavily fortified French-German border known as the Maginot line. With the exception of the French invasion of the Saarland shortly after the war began, however, once Poland was defeated and German reinforcements arrived the French immediately retreated behind the border. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">The war was relatively quiet in the months following the Polish surrender. Very few battles occurred on this front, there was no further development on the battlefield or diplomatically. For these reasons, this segment of the war is known as the &ldquo;Phony War&rdquo;. This inaction gave the German forces ample time to prepare for an imminent invasion. When the Germans finally made their move, it took the allied forces by complete surprise. Instead of invading across the heavily fortified French-German border as expected, they sent a spearhead through the Ardennes forest between Belgium and France to the north. This region was thought at the time to be impassable because of the terrain and thus wasn&rsquo;t defended. The German gamble prevailed. The bulk of the allied forces were surrounded in the Northern French town of Dunkerque (Dunkirk). France fell in a matter of weeks after the invasion began. The Spanish who sought refuge in France now found themselves under the rule of yet another European fascist. This time, they wouldn&rsquo;t be able to escape their fate. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">Right at the end of Preston&rsquo;s book, he details the fate of the Spanish in France after the German occupation began in the spring of 1940.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&ldquo;Perhaps the most shocking example of the malice that underlay the Francoist treatment of the defeated Republicans was the fate of the Spanish exiles captured in France by the Germans. Some had been fighting in the French forces, others were still in French internment camps. Around 10,000 ended up in German camps, something made possible by the acquiescence of Franco&rsquo;s government when the prisoners were offered by the Germans&hellip;. According to SS Standartenf&uuml;hrer August Eigruber, Gauleiter of Oberdonau in Austria, the Germans were told &lsquo;by Franco&rsquo; that, as they had fought for &lsquo;a Soviet Spain&rsquo;, the prisoners were not considered to be Spaniards. This is consistent with Franco&rsquo;s public declarations about those Republicans regarded as unredeemable criminals. Accordingly, the Spanish prisoners were treated as stateless persons and transferred from the front-line prisoner-of-war camps (Stalags) to concentration camps. Ninety per cent of the &lsquo;Fighters for Red Spain&rsquo; (Rotspanienkampfer) were in Mauthausen in Austria&rdquo; (Preston 515-516).</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;As Preston points out, Mauthausen was just one of the camps the Republicans were subject to. However, 60 percent of the Spanish Republicans who died in German camps perished in Mauthausen (Preston 516). Preston provides initial statistics about the first Spanish sent to concentration camps but leaves it at that. He does not go into detail about the experiences of these Republicans, as that doesn&rsquo;t concern with the main topic of the persecution in Spain. Thus to further explore the Spanish in the German concentration camps, we will have to explore other source material.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c9 c15">According to the United States Holocaust Museum,</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">5,000 Spanish Republicans ended up in Nazi concentration camps after 1940. Almost 7,000 Catholic priests, monks, and nuns were killed, primarily in the first months of the revolt. Nazi authorities conscripted Spanish Republicans for forced labor and deported more than 30,000 to Germany, where about half of them ended up in concentration camps. Some 7,000 of these became prisoners in Mauthausen; more than half of them died in the camp.&rdquo; Considering that Mauthausen seems to be the camp where the majority of the Republicans fell victim to Nazi extermination, and where the source material is available, thus the experiences of the Spanish in Mauthausen will be examined. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Sara J. Brenneis, an associate professor of Spanish at Amherst College, in 2018 published a book by the title &ldquo;Spaniard In Mauthausen&rdquo;. This book offers the first study of the Spaniards who were imprisoned and killed during the Second World War in the Nazi concentration camp in Mauthausen. She also includes in the latter stages of the book how the memories of Mauthausen are handled within post-Franco Spain up until the present day. In addition, her introduction covers the memory and legacy of the Holocaust in Spain in a general sense. All of this will help us in our assessment of the current-day status of the commemoration of the many Spanish Republicans who died to mass imprisonment and murder within Spain and under the Nazi holocaust. First, we will cover the conditions of Mauthausen, and then turn back to the current-day memory when we address that in its totality at the end of this paper.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Brenneis opens her segment on Mauthausen in a similar manner to how Preston closed his book. She begins with a more general overview of how the Spanish fared as prisoners in Mauthausen. She then goes into detail to describe individual experiences to really relay how one of these prisoners endured the Nazi horror at a much more relatable level as opposed to numbers and statistics. She recounts many of the things Preston noted in her general overview, perhaps directly from Preston himself. She mentions how the Spanish were forced to work as hard as they could until they were unable to, and were then promptly killed (Brenneis 41). Preston notes this as well in less detail on page 516 in his book. More noteworthy is how the Germans were able to resupply their slave labor. &ldquo;Those who died were quickly replaced by more incoming prisoners: the last convoy of more than a hundred Spaniards arrived on 19 December 1941, though more Spanish Republicans would continue to arrive in Mauthausen in smaller groups until April 1945 (Marsalek 141-50). In these Spaniards, the Nazis found a continuously refreshed stable of slave labour to exploit&rdquo; (Brenneis 41-42). From this, we can deduce that the Spanish were victims up until the last moment of the German surrender in 1945. It was not a one time deal, they endured the terror throughout the whole course of the Holocaust.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">As she acknowledges, the experiences of the Spaniards in Mauthausen were overlooked after the war. On the world stage, this makes sense, as they constituted a small fraction of the overall population in the Nazi concentration camps. In addition, the Spaniards were held in the camps for political reasons, not racial reasons. They were spared from the worst that Mauthausen had to offer. Jews, on the other hand, were treated far worse in Mauthausen and throughout the Holocaust. Most Jews were sent straight to death, surviving through hard labor wasn&rsquo;t even an option. At the end of World War II, the Holocaust was the main focus of the post-war trials. The Nuremberg trials investigated the Nazis who were responsible for the systematic murder of millions of Jews during the war. While the Spanish Republicans suffered at the hands of the Nazis like many others, they were not considered victims of the Holocaust and were thus overlooked after the war. Again, on a world stage this makes sense, the thousands of Spanish who suffered during the war dwarfs the millions who were murdered by Nazis in concentration camps. However, in Spain itself, the Spanish men and women who suffered in Mauthausen are rarely acknowledged.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">As Brenneis describes in her introduction segment devoted to the memory of the Holocaust in Spain, the memory of the Spaniards in the Holocaust is a complicated subject in modern day Spain. During the days of Franco, a culture of fear and repression was established. The perspective of the government was the perspective of the people, those who disagreed were silenced. This laid a precedent for how Spain dealt with its memory of the past. Of course, during Franco&rsquo;s rule, the idea that Franco committed such egregious acts could not be conjured. Free thought was discouraged, the government&rsquo;s representation of the past was accepted as a fact. On the world stage, as more secrets of the Holocaust were uncovered during the 1960s and 1970s, Spain remained silent. As Brenneis discusses, now that Franco&rsquo;s days are far behind us, Spain is attempting to catch up with the rest of the world on acknowledging its ties to the Holocaust. Because the amount of Spanish men affected by the Holocaust is so minuscule in comparison to the Jews affected, Spain has been unable to acknowledge its own as victims of the Holocaust (Brenneis 4-5). She goes into lengthy descriptions about the background surrounding the war, Franco&rsquo;s role and relationship with Hitler and the background of Mauthausen itself. She devoted other sections in her book on how Mauthausen has evolved over the years. Most of which is an interesting read, but fails to answer the big questions. How are these people remembered today?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">The status of today&rsquo;s memory of the oppressed Spaniards during the 30s and 40s is hard to pinpoint to a definite statement. Spain has, for the most part, retained the strategy of silence, and has left its past in the past. Exhibitions of the Holocaust has appeared in the country, but not specifically to the Spanish who have suffered. Spain during World War II played an interesting role as an ally to the Axis, but a neutral country in the conflict. As a result, many Jews sought to flee to Spain to seek refuge from the Nazi slaughter. Ironically, thousands of Jews were saved by managing to reach Spain during the war. However, by 1942, Germany demanded that Spain remove all of its Jewish citizens from Western Europe. Spain had the opportunity to save 4,000 of its own, but only 800 were spared. After the war, Spain claimed that it had protected all of its Jews, its real actions were kept hidden from the general public. Again another example of Spain attempting to keep its past hidden from itself. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10">Today in Spain, improvements have been made in an effort to remember the Spanish lives lost in the Holocaust. Memorials have been erected throughout Spain over the past decade commemorating the victims of the Holocaust, as well as the Spaniards who died in Mauthausen. Despite the complications with Spain&rsquo;s own past during Franco&rsquo;s rule, Spain became a full member of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance in 2008. The Holocaust has been introduced into the education system and participates during Holocaust Remembrance Day in an effort to help remember the victims from the past. The recognition of the Holocaust and the Spaniards specifically in who were victims have gradually improved as of recently. However, small monuments scattered throughout the country could only have so much of an effect. On the other hand, a Spanish film was recently released by the name of </span><span class="c8">El fotografo de Mauthausen</span><span class="c2">. The film provides a fascinating insight into how the Spaniards may have experienced life in the Nazi concentration camps. It is a dramatic movie, so it is not all factual but it is definitely worth a watch, especially for Spanish people today. A film like this which is easily accessible will help bring the issue of Mauthausen into the more normative sphere in Spain especially if it was shown in school for educational purposes. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">While that aspect of the Spanish memory or rather an amnesia has improved, the issue of Franco&rsquo;s holocaust has remained more controversial. Franco left such a scar on Spain, that it is still very hesitant to uncover its past. &nbsp;The Valle de los Ca&iacute;dos remains a permanent reminder of Franco&rsquo;s warped version of Spanish history. A memorial said to commemorate those who fell on both sides during the Spanish Civil War, yet was built by imprisoned Republicans and houses both Franco&rsquo;s and of Jose Antonio Primo de Rivera, the founder of the Spanish Falangist movement. Overlooking the monument is a huge cross, a stark reminder of what Franco fought for. Pro Falangists who have gathered there in support of Franco&rsquo;s legacy forced the government to ban all political rallies there in 2007. Just recently the Spanish government has decided to move Franco&rsquo;s body to be buried next to his wife in the cemetery at El Pardo in June 2019. Discussion over how to best repurpose this monument remains in discussion till today. However, this is just one piece of Franco&rsquo;s bloody history that Spain has worked on addressing publicly.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10">After Franco&rsquo;s death in 1975, Spain was able to peacefully transition to democracy. One of the tough decisions the new politicians in power were faced with was the question of how to deal with Franco&rsquo;s legacy as the leader of Spain for almost four decades. To ensure a smooth transition from autocracy to democracy, they decided to avoid dealing with the legacy of Franco. This decision is known as the Pact of Forgetting. No prosecutions were held against those who were responsible for the mass suffering under Franco. This ensured that no difficult questions were raised during the transition. The pact was made an official law under the Spanish 1977 Amnesty Law. While many historians agree the pact served a purpose during the transition, it still remains in law today and remains a point of controversy. While the works of Preston and others have helped bring the atrocities of the Franco regime to the world stage, Spain still refuses to come to terms with its past. The United Nations have urged Spain on multiple occasions to repeal the 1977 law, but no progress has been made on that front. A film released just last year in Spain and released in the U.S. this May, </span><span class="c8">El Silencio de Otros</span><span class="c2">, explores the struggles of the victims of Franco&rsquo;s tyranny in present-day Spain. The film follows the survivors&rsquo; pursuit of justice in the organization of the &ldquo;Argentine Lawsuit&rdquo; against the Franco-era crimes they endured. They engage in the fight against the state-imposed amnesia from the crimes against humanity under the Franco regime. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10">To this day, Spain has yet to come to terms with its dark past. The tactic of forgetting still holds true, it is uncertain when or if Spain will abandon this policy. Spain stands in stark contrast to Germany, who has pursued the opposite strategy in dealing with their past. After the war, Germany has fully acknowledged its crimes committed during the war and have sought forgiveness. They have paid millions of dollars in reparation to Israel since the war ended. In Berlin today resides a big memorial to the Jews who died in the Holocaust from the Nazi slaughter. In addition to the memorial, a museum in Berlin by the name of, </span><span class="c8">Topography of Terror</span><span class="c2">, is dedicated to the terror committed by the Nazi regime over the course of their rule in Germany. Germany has come to terms with its past and has served as a leading example for helping the world remember the atrocities committed just decades ago. Among the world Holocaust organizations, preserving the memory of the Holocaust is of the utmost importance. The common belief is that by remembering, we will prevent the same thing from occurring in the future. Nothing of the same magnitude has occurred since however examples such as the Rwandan Genocide serve to tell us that comparable acts are far from becoming extinct.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Through the works of Preston, Graham, and Brenneis, we have been able to explore the neglected topic of the persecution of the Spanish Republicans during Franco&rsquo;s rule in Spain. While their work is valued, the true problem of state institutionalized amnesia in Spain remains. Preston provides a great basis for serving as key evidence against the legacy of the Franco regime. His great lengths of research and detail are apparent throughout his whole work. He makes it clear that many Spaniards suffered at the mercy of Franco and his fascist regime. He doesn&#39;t leave a shadow of a doubt of how widespread the suffering was during and after the Spanish Civil War. The effect was great, while I may disagree that it qualifies as a &ldquo;Holocaust&rdquo;, it certainly deserves to be recognized at that level for Spain. Yet no matter how many historians decide to explore the subject, true reconciliation must come from the state itself. The Spaniards who suffered at the hands of the Germans remains a small footnote in history to this day. Considering only a small number of Spaniards suffered while millions of Jews perished, this makes sense. However, because this isn&rsquo;t qualified to be repressed under the Pact of Forgetting, it has received some recognition in Spain. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Today, as is the case with Holocaust survivors, we are reaching a point where the survivors of Franco&rsquo;s terror are shrinking and number. The window of time that justice can still be fulfilled is shrinking even smaller after every passing minute. Now more than ever it is crucial to hear the stories of the survivors. Spain&rsquo;s democracy has remained stable since its transition; the Pact of Forgetting may be hard to abandon but Spain has lagged behind the recognition of 20th-century terrors from its European neighbors. It is baffling that Germany has done the best job of coming to terms with its past considering what it is responsible for. Spain has only so much time to revisit its past and enable those who seek justice to finally receive it. In 1948 Winston Churchill said in the House of Commons &ldquo;Those who fail to learn from history are condemned to repeat it&rdquo;. This notion has been the driving force behind the movement to remember the Holocaust every year on International Holocaust Day. Only time will tell if Spain decides to follow the world&rsquo;s example and bring the decades-long state induced amnesia to an end.</span></p><p class="c6 c23"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c18"><span class="c2">Works Cited</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c14 c24">Brenneis, Sara J..
